Processed data
1. clean data and Change the Marital-status in the original data to unify it into married and unmarried statuses (save in pro_adult_data.data)
2. Create a new table named adult_data and then use the COPY command to import the pro_adult_data.data into PostgreSQL
3. Filter the data again based on the married and unmarried statuses, creating two new tables accordingly. (one is married_data, the other is unmarried_data)

If you need to use this data in a local database, simply create the adult_data table and import the pro_adult_data.data file. Then, follow the steps outlined in the CreateDataBase.sql file to filter and create the other two tables.
